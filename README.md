#  _Explanation of the development of the hangman game code._  :woman_technologist::woman_technologist:

In the first place, the basic structure of the code was planned by means of a pseudocode. 

 `Pseudocode of the basic code structure. `

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Start.] -->B(Print: Welcome to the hangman game.) 
    -->y(Ask the user if he/she is going to play alone or in pairs)
    y -->e(Yes) --> ex(Enable 2 player mode) --> E
    y --> r(No)
    
    --> E("Ask the user (or users) to choose a level.
    ")
    E --> F(Level: Easy.) --> I(" â€¢ 11 attempts
    â€¢ 8-12 letters in the word.
    ") -->L
    E --> G(Level: Intermediate.) --> J(" â€¢  10 attempts
    â€¢ 5-8 letters in the word.
    ") -->L
    E --> H(Level: Hard.) --> K(" â€¢  5 attempts
    â€¢  5 > letters in the word.
    ") 
    --> L(" â€¢ Generate a random word that corresponds to the game difficulty.
     â€¢  Print a hangman design corresponding to the game difficulty.
     â€¢  Print underscores representing the length of the random word.
    ") 
    --> W("Ask the user to enter a letter.
    (If the game is in pairs mode, the users will be taking turns.)
    ")
    --> R{Does the entered letter belong to the generated word?}
    R -->n(No) --> q("â€¢ Add letter to the list of failed letters.
    â€¢ Print part of the hangman design.
    â€¢ Print failed letters.
    â€¢ Indicate a lost attempt.
    ") -->u{"Have the user (or users) lost all their attempts?
    "}
    u -->o(Yes) -->S("Game over. 
    Show the correct word. 
    ") --> P
    u--> t(No) --> W
    
    R -->Y(Yes) --> T("
    â€¢ Print the updated underscores with the new letter.
    â€¢ Compare the list with the string of the generated word.
    â€¢ (If the game is in pairs mode, a point will be added to the scoreboard)
    ") -->U{Is the word completed?} 
    U -->O(Yes) --> k("Print: You won
    (If the game is in pairs mode, the scores will be displayed)
    ")
    --> P(Ask the user or users if they want to play again)
    P --> b(No) --> w[End]
    P--> a(Yes) -->y
    U --> i(No) -->W
   
```

## â€¢ Explanation of each function.

Here we explain the operation of the three helper functions that make the main code work.

`The "clr()" function clears the screen using the os method ".system()".`

```python
import os
def clr():
    return os.system('cls')
```
Although the expression for clearing the screen is fairly short, it is used several times in the code, for that reason we defined an even shorter expression. 


`The "level()" function allows the user to choose a level and bassed on the choice, selects a word.`

```python
from  wonderwords import RandomWord
def level() -> str:
    r = RandomWord()

    choice = None
    while choice not in [1, 2, 3]:
        choice = int(input("1, 2 or 3"))
        clr()
    match choice:
        case 1:
            info = [r.word(word_min_length=8, word_max_length=19), 1]
        case 2:
            info = [r.word(word_min_length=5, word_max_length=8), 2]
        case 3:
            info = [r.word(word_max_length=5), 3]

    return info
```
In order to establish the difficulty level we tried different combinations of wordlenghts and number of tries. We end up with the easy level being a long word (case 1) with 11 tries and the hard level (case 3), a word of less than 5 letters and only 5 attempts. In the above code, case 1 is a word that has between 8 and 19 letters. The number of tries is defined by how many pictures the hangman drawing has. 
For generating the words we used a library called [**wonderwords**](https://pypi.org/project/wonderwords/). From that library we imported the **RandomWord** class and when generating a word we call the **word** method.

`We also wrote a function "color()" for coloring the three different hangman motives.`

```python
def color(num:int, picture:str):
    match num:
        case 1:
            c = "\033[96m{}\033[0m".format(picture)
            return c
        case 2:
            c = "\033[93m{}\033[0m".format(picture)
            return c
        case 3:
            c = "\033[35m{}\033[0m".format(picture)
            return c
```
For assigning a color to the text in the python console we used the [ANSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#cite_note-CruzGianone1997-31:// "ANSI") escape codes.

## â€¢ Libraries.

To enable the functionality of the game code, three libraries were imported.

1. **Time:** This library is used to make a delay when the user enters a repeated letter, it prints a message and resumes the game.
   
   ```Python
    elif char in failed_letts: # when letter was already inputted
            print("Try a new letter!")
            time.sleep(2)
   ```
2. **wonderwords:** This library, which  generates random words with varying lengths and categories, can be installed using the command prompt (cmd).
  ```bash
    pip install wonderwords
  ```
  or downloading the requirements file and running the following command in a virtual environment: 
  
  ```bash
    py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```
  
3. **Os:** This library allows access to the operating system, enabling interaction with various system functionalities.

## â€¢ Files 

In this section we will explain the content and function of each file.

* In the **_hangman.py_** file is the main program and is the file you run when playing the game.
  
* In the **_hangmanFunctions.py_** you will find the helper functions, which are imported to the hangman file.

* There are two options for the drawings. You can either download the **_'drawings.json'_** file or use the **_'text_to_json.py'_** script. The first file contains the drawings in an unreadable format but allows you to play the game immediately. The second option provides the drawings in their original design, but you need to run the 'text_to_json.py' script before executing 'hangman.py'. By running 'text_to_json.py', you will create the 'drawings.json' file, and everything will be ready to start playing.

* In **_requirements.txt_** you will find the libraries that you need to install in order to run the code, in this case the only library is wonderwords.

###  _Steps to install the game._ :open_file_folder:

Get ready for game time! In order to play, you'll need to download the code. 

Wondering how? Don't worry, we'll guide you through the process below. :memo:

1. To begin, please ensure that Python is installed on your device.

If you are unsure about the installation process, you can follow the [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to install Python on your device.

2. After successfully installing Python, you will need to download the files attached in this repository.

<p align="center">
