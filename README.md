##  _Explanation of the development of the hangman game code._  :woman_technologist::woman_technologist::man_technologist:

In the first place, the basic structure of the code was planned by means of a pseudocode. 

 `Pseudocode of the basic code structure. `

    --> D("`Level 1: Easy.
    Level 2: Intermediate.
    Level 3: Hard.`")
    --> E(Allow users to choose a level.)

    a-b letters in the word.

    E --> H(Level: Hard.) --> K(" X attempts
    a-b letters in the word.

    --> L(Generate a random word using a python library.)
